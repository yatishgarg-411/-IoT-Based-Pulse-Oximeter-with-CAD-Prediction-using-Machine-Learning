###### ðŸ”¹ On Windows (Find COM Port)
1. Open Device Manager
2. Press Win + X â†’ Click Device Manager.
3. Expand "Ports (COM & LPT)"
4. Look for "USB Serial Device (COMx)".
5. Example: COM3, COM5, etc.
6. Use the COM number in your Python code
7. If you see USB Serial Device (COM3), set: SERIAL_PORT = 'COM3'
###### ðŸ”¹ On Mac/Linux (Find /dev/ Port)
1. Open Terminal (Cmd + Space â†’ Type Terminal â†’ Enter).
2. Run this command to list all serial devices: ls /dev/cu.*
3. Look for your device
4. You should see something like:
/dev/cu.usbserial-0001
5. Use that in your Python script:
SERIAL_PORT = '/dev/cu.usbserial-0001'

### 5. Machine Learning Model
1. Train the provided dataset (`dataset.csv`) using the ensemble ML model in the notebook.
2. Use the trained model to predict CAD from SpO2 and BPM values.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of BPM and SpO2.
- Bluetooth functionality for wireless data transfer.
- CAD prediction using an ensemble ML model (ANN, SVM, Logistic Regression).

---

## How It Works
1. The hardware collects BPM and SpO2 readings for 20 seconds per person.
2. Data is sent via Bluetooth as well as serial monitor and logged into Google Sheets using a Python script.
3. The ML model processes the data to predict the likelihood of CAD.
4. The results are displayed and stored for further analysis.
