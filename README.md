IoT-Based Pulse Oximeter with CAD Prediction

An IoT-based project that measures BPM (Beats Per Minute) and SpO2 (Oxygen Saturation) levels using a custom-built hardware setup. The collected data is automatically logged into Google Sheets and analyzed with a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).

Introduction

This project integrates IoT, real-time data monitoring, and machine learning to predict CAD (Coronary Artery Disease). The hardware collects heart rate and oxygen saturation data, which is logged to Google Sheets and processed by an ensemble ML model for prediction.
Hardware Components

ESP32: Microcontroller for data processing and Bluetooth communication.
MAX30100/MAX30102: Pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor.
I2C Display (Optional): To display BPM and SpO2 in real-time.
Power Source: Rechargeable Li-Po battery and battery management module.
Breadboard, Resistors, and Jumper Wires: For circuit prototyping.
Software Components

Arduino IDE: For programming the ESP32.
Python Jupyter Notebook: For data logging and machine learning.
Google Sheets API: For automatic data storage.
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc., for prediction.
Hardware Connections

MAX30100 Pin	ESP32 Pin
VIN	3.3V
GND	GND
SCL	GPIO 22
SDA	GPIO 21
If using an I2C display, connect its SCL and SDA to GPIO 22 and GPIO 21 respectively.
Setup Instructions

1. Hardware Setup
Assemble the ESP32 and MAX30100 sensor as per the above connections.
Optional: Connect the I2C display for real-time data visualization.
Power the setup with a Li-Po battery or USB connection.
2. Arduino Code
Install the necessary Arduino libraries in the /libraries folder.
Open the Pulse_Oximeter.ino file in Arduino IDE.
Upload the code to the ESP32.
3. Google Sheets Integration
Enable the Google Sheets API.
Download your Service Account JSON key and save it as ml-project-441108-d4e5cf52b0af.json.
Configure the Jupyter notebook to log data into your Google Sheet.
4. Machine Learning Model
Train the provided dataset (dataset.csv) using the ensemble ML model in the notebook.
Use the trained model to predict CAD from SpO2 and BPM values.
Features

Real-time monitoring of BPM and SpO2.
Bluetooth functionality for wireless data transfer.
Automatic data logging to Google Sheets.
CAD prediction using an ensemble ML model (ANN, SVM, Logistic Regression).
How It Works

The hardware collects BPM and SpO2 readings for 20 seconds per person.
Data is sent via Bluetooth and logged into Google Sheets using a Python script.
The ML model processes the data to predict the likelihood of CAD.
The results are displayed and stored for further analysis.

Results

The trained ensemble ML model achieved:
Accuracy: 95%
Precision: 93%
Recall: 94%
The prediction model reliably identifies potential CAD cases based on SpO2 and BPM levels.
Future Enhancements

Add a mobile app for real-time monitoring.
Integrate more sensors for additional health metrics.
Improve battery life for standalone operation.
